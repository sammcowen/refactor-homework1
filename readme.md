# Horiseon Webpage Refactor

Horiseon Social Solutions Services is a company that helps business owners use technology to increase sales and revenue.
They do this through Search Engine Optimization, Online Reputation Management and Social Media Marketing.This is a very valuable service to business owners to increase sales and revenue through how their websites and applications are presented on the web. This is their landing page. 

# WHY
Horiseon needed some help getting their page to function properly and to make sure it came up on search engine results based on the markup of the html of the page. Refactoring and changing their html to better semantic elements will help ALL users experience the site. 

# WHAT I DID 
I gave the page a concise title that shows in the web browser tab, instead of "website" as it was prior. 
I was able to make sure all the links on the naivgation bar functioned properly and jump to the proper section of the page when the user clicks it, as it did NOT prior.
I was able to change the html in a way that did NOT CHANGE the desired layout of the page , but allowed for better seo results , by using SEMANTIC HTML instead of just divs, as the page was written prior. 
I condensed the css stylesheet and html to be shorter and easier to read. I also added comments describing why the css was applied and what it is doing to the page.I also added accessibilty and alternate image descirptions for people who use screen readers or when the images don't load.

# SCREENSHOT BEFORE & AFTER CSS FILE, BEFORE & AFTER TITLE TAB
Below is a screenshot of the style.css originally having 200 lines, I added comments and refactored it to 136 for my final deployed project.

Below is a screenshot of the original title displayed as  undescriptive 'website', vs my updated concise company name.

# HOW THIS HELPS
This helps Horiseon's page meet accessibilty standards , improve their search engine results, and gives the page functionality that is up to date with semantic html.

# WHAT I LEARNED 
During this project I learned how important it is to be concise, efficient and clear. Not only to help the client's page function prooperly, but ALSO for other developers to easily understand why your code is there and what it's meant to do.
I also realized the importance of the work behind the accessibility standards. It is our duty to make sure EVERYONE can utilize the web.
I also learned that there are MANY WAYS to make changes, but sometimes they will change the client's vision or desired outcome. It is IMPORTANT to stick to the CLIENT"S WISHES  and use coding that meets their DESIRED output and functionality. 
Not just what is easier for myself as the dev.
